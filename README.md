# House Marketplace

Find and list houses for sale or for rent. This is a React / Firebase v9 project from the React Front To Back 2022 course by Brad Traversy.

## Usage

### Geolocation

Google geocoding can be used to automatically get the cordinates of the address provided by the user. You need to either add your Google Geocode API key to a .env file OR in the **CreateListing.jsx** file you can set **geolocationEnabled** to "false" and it will add a lat/lng field to the form.

### Run

```bash
npm init
npm start
```
